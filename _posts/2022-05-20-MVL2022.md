<h2>Special Issue on Multiple-Valued Logic and Applications in Journal of Applied Logics  (JALs)</h2>



[The Journal of Applied Logics (JALs-ifCoLog)](https://www.collegepublications.co.uk/ifcolog/) will publish a special issue on Multiple-Valued Logic and Applications. You are invited to submit an article on any subject in the area of multiple-valued logic, including but not limited to the following areas of interests:

- Circuit/Device Implementation    
- Multi-bit per Cell Logic & Memory
- Multiple-Valued Decision Diagrams
- MVL Aspects of Nanotechnology
- Quantum Computing
- System-on-Chip Technology
- Test and Verification
- VLSI Architecture and Computing
- Brain Scale Integration Circuits and Computing
- Reversible, Stochastic Computing
- Application of MVL to Medical Technologies, Robotics, Machine Learning
- Spectral Techniques
- Algebra and Formal Aspects
- MVL approaches to Data Mining and Big Data

Articles and topics should be addressed primarily to the diverse readership of JALs-ifCoLog. Unpublished and original work is However extended articles from the IEEE ISMVL 2022 can be submitted as well. Articles should target novel and emerging end-applications of multiple-valued logic. Authors should submit papers by using the guidelines and template that can be found at the bottom of this page and, sending pdf files directly to martin.lukac@nu.edu.kz, yuminaka@gunma-u.ac.jp, kns@uchicago.edu. Each manuscript should follow [Guidelines](/docs/GuideForAuthors.pdf) in the guide for authors and use the [Latex Template](/docs/myifcolog.cls). This special issue will follow the schedule below:


- August 25, 2022: Due date for papers
