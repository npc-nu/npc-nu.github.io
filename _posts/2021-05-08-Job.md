We are loking for two postdocs and two phd students in the area of Neural Cryptography. The work is situated within a new project starting in June 2021 and will last for two and half year with possibility of extension. 

The content of the work is aimed at developing high throughput accelerated libraries for machine learning, manipulation of encrypted data and scale up experimentation in massively large Neural Networks. 

The required skills are at least one of the following:
 - Python or c/c++ programming
 - Deep learning experience or at least practical knowledge (pytorch, tensorflow,etc)
 - Understanding (or at least experience with working with)  of the TLS traffic encryption
 - Understanding (or at least experience with working with) of standard public and private encryption algorithms
 - High-throughput parallel programming (CUDA, MPI, OpenCL)

The goal of the project is the implementation of a high through put platform for the evaluation of Neural Networks Architectures for cryptoanalysis of encrypted trafic and data. 

Applications should be sent to newparadigmcomputing@gmail.com and should include:

    - motivation letter
    - CV including a list of publications
    - list of the referees
    - research statement

The position(s) will remain open until filled.

Start of the Job as soon as possible
regards
NPC Team
