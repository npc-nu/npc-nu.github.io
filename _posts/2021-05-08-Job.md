We are loking for two postdocs and two phd students in the area of Neural Cryptography. The work is situated within a new project starting in June 2021 and will last for two and half year with possibility of extension. 

The content of the work is aimed at developing high throughput accelerated libraries for machine learning, manipulation of encrypted data and scale up experimentation in massively large Neural Networks. 

The required skills are at least one of the following:
 - Python or c/c++ programming
 - Deep learning experience or at least practical knowledge (pytorch, tensorflow,etc)
 - Understanding of the TLS traffic encryption
 - Understanding of standard public and private encryption algorithms
 - High-throughput parallel programming (CUDA, MPI, OpenCL)

The goal of the project is the implementation of a high through put platform for the evaluation of Neural Networks Architectures for cryptoanalysis of encrypted trafic and data. 

Start of the Job June/July 2021
