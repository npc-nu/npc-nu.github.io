Journal of Applied Logics  (JALs)
Special Issue on Multiple-Valued Logic and Applications

CALL FOR PAPERS

The JournaL of Applied Logics (JALs-ifCoLog) will publish a special issue on Multiple-Valued Logic and Applications. You are invited to submit an article on any subject in the area of multiple-valued logic, including but not limited to:

Circuit/Device Implementation    
Multi-bit per cell logic & memory
Multiple-Valued Decision Diagrams
MVL Aspects of Nanotechnology
Quantum Computing
System-on-Chip Technology
Test and Verification
VLSI Architecture and Computing
Brain Scale Integration Circuits and Computing
Reversible, Stochastic Computing
Application of MVL to Medical Technologies, robotics, machine learning
Spectral Techniques
Algebra and Formal Aspects
MVL approaches to Data Mining and Big Data

Articles and topics should be addressed primarily to the diverse readership of JALs-ifCoLog. Unpublished and original work is However extended articles from the IEEE ISMVL 2020 can be submitted as well. Articles should target novel and emerging end-applications of multiple-valued logic. Authors should submit papers by using the guidelines and template that can be found at npc.nu.edu.kz/mvl2020 and sending pdf files directly to martin.lukac@nu.edu.kz, yuminaka@gunma-u.ac.jp, kns@uchicago.edu.
