<h3>Algorithm Selection and Meta Learning</h3>
  
The Meta-Learning is one of the available approaches for optimization of machine learning, knowledge discovery and reasoning. It offers a variety of possibilities such as algorithm design, algorithm merging, algorithm selection etc. In our group we study the application of algorithm selection and meta learning to real-world problems. In particular:

  - Optimization of computer vision
  
  - Massive Ensembles for Algorithm Selection
  
  - Using alternative sources of information for meta-learning
  
  - Reasoning for algorithm selection
