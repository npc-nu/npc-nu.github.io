<h2>Convolutional Neural Networks Optimization</h2>

Currently the Artificial Intelligence group is investigating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) optimization using binarization and Semantic Pruning. The purpose of these approaches and method is to:

  - Reduce the size of CNNs and determine the minimal complexity of CNN parameters in order to make them current hardware friendly.
  
   - Understand the learning and the process of storing learned patterns in the featre space
   
   - Provide a theory for understanding the learning and inference processes (Explainable AI)
